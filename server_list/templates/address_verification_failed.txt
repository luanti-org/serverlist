Server address does not include a DNS record for the IP that the announcement was sent from.
Announce IP: {{ announce_ip }}
Address records: {{ valid_addresses | join ", " }}

Help: This is usually because your server is only listening on IPv4 but your announcement is being sent over IPv6.
If that is the case there are two ways to fix this:
 1. (preferred) Set ipv6_server = true in your server config to listen on IPv6 and add your IPv6 address to DNS as an AAAA record.
    On Linux this allows clients to connect using both IPv4 and IPv6 (unless you have enabled net.ipv6.bind6only).
    On other operating systems this option may only work with IPv6 clients and you'll have to use the second option if you want to support IPv4.
 2. Set bind_address = 0.0.0.0 in your server config to force IPv4 only, the announce will then be sent from the IPv4 address.
