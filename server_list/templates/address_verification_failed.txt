Server address does not include a DNS record for the IP that the announcement was sent from.
Announce IP: {{ announce_ip }}
Address records: {{ valid_addresses | join ", " }}

Help: This is usually because your server is only listening on IPv4 but your announcement is being sent over IPv6.
There are two ways to fix this:
 1. (preferred) Set bind_address = :: in your server config to listen on IPv6 and add your IPv6 address to DNS as an AAAA record.
    This allows both IPv4 and IPv6 because the linux kernel will forward IPv4 requests to the IPv6 socket by default using an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address (look up IPV6_V6ONLY for more information).
    On other operating systems this option may not work and you'll have to use the second option.
 2. Set bind_address = 0.0.0.0 in your server config to force IPv4 only, the announce will then be sent from the IPv4 address.
